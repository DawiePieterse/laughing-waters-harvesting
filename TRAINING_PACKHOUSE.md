# Pack House Receiving — Training Guide

For staff at the pack house gate, checking in loads as trucks arrive.

---

## What this screen does

Your screen shows every load that's been dispatched from the field and
is on its way to you, oldest first. When a truck arrives, you find its
load in the list, check what actually came in, and confirm receipt.

---

## Understanding the queue

Each load in the list is colored:

- 🟢 **Green** — recently dispatched, no rush.
- 🟡 **Yellow** — has been in transit a while, offload soon.
- 🔴 **Red** — has been waiting too long. **Offload red loads before
  green ones**, even if a green one arrived more recently — litchis
  lose quality fast once picked, and red means this load needs it most.

The list is already sorted oldest-first, so working from the top down is
almost always the right order.

## Receiving a load, step by step

1. Find the load in the list — match it by driver name or slip number if
   several trucks are waiting.
2. Tap it to open the receiving form.
3. Check **Expected crates** (shown at the top) against what's actually
   on the truck, and type the real count into **Actual crates
   received**.
4. Tick the **Condition** that applies — Good, Damaged, Sunburn, Wet, or
   Other. You can tick more than one if needed.
5. Add any **Notes** if something's worth flagging (e.g. "2 crates
   crushed in transit").
6. Type your name in **Received by**.
7. Tap **Confirm Receipt**.

That's it — the load moves out of the queue and the office can see it as
received.

### If the actual count doesn't match what was expected

Just enter the real number you counted — don't adjust it to match the
expected figure. The system automatically records the difference
(a "discrepancy") so the office can see it; that's normal and expected
when it happens, not something you need to fix or explain in the app
itself.

## Logging an external delivery

Use this when a truck arrives directly from **another farm/supplier**
that doesn't use our field devices — their fruit was never "dispatched"
through the app, so there's no existing load to find in the queue.

1. Tap **Log External Delivery** (top of the screen).
2. Choose the **Supplier**.
3. Enter the **Crates** and **Total Kg** on the truck.
4. Enter the **Driver** name.
5. Add **Notes** if needed.
6. Tap **Add to In-transit**.

This adds it to the same queue as any other load — you'll then receive
it the normal way (find it in the list, tap it, confirm receipt) once
it's actually offloaded.

---

## Working without signal

If the connection drops, an **amber bar** appears at the top and the list
keeps showing the last queue it loaded, so you can still see what was on
its way. The time at the top right changes to something like *"offline -
last update 4 min ago"* — that's your reminder the list is a snapshot,
not live. It refreshes itself once the connection is back.

**Confirming a receipt does need the connection.** If it can't get
through you'll see *"Could not confirm - check connection and retry"* and
nothing is saved — the load stays in the list. Check the load in again
once you're back online. (Unlike the field devices, receipts are not
stored up to send later, so don't assume it went through.)

---

## If something looks wrong

- **A load you're expecting isn't in the list** — it may not have been
  dispatched yet from the field, or may already have been received by
  someone else. Check with the field station or the office before
  assuming something's broken.
- **Wrong crate count already confirmed?** You can't edit a receipt from
  this screen once it's submitted — tell the office so they can correct
  it.
- **Screen looks out of date** — tap the status pill, top right (it turns
  red when offline), or drag down from the top of the list and let go.
