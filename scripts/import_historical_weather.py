"""Backfill of hourly weather history from Open-Meteo's historical-forecast
API into the WeatherHistory table, for correlating conditions with harvest
data (2020 onward) on the admin/owner Weather tab.

Unlike the harvest import this isn't a true one-off: re-run it periodically
to pick up the days since the last import - it's safe to re-run, since it
replaces this script's own date range (HISTORY_START_DATE onward) each
time rather than appending. (The app itself also keeps the table current
on every Weather tab open - see weather.sync_recent_weather() - this
script is for a full rebuild.)

Only ever deletes/reinserts HISTORY_START_DATE onward, so it composes
safely with scripts/import_historical_weather_archive.py's older backfill
(1987 up to the day before HISTORY_START_DATE) regardless of which one
runs first or how many times either is re-run.

Usage (run with the backend's own venv so sqlmodel etc. are on the path):
