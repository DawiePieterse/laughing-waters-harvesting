    """Daily-aggregated WeatherHistory for the Weather tab - see _METRICS
    for per-metric aggregation. Grouped by plain calendar year (1 Jan -
    31 Dec), deliberately NOT the Aug-anchored harvest season used
    elsewhere in this app (analysis.py's _season_day) - weather doesn't
    follow the picking season the way harvest data does, and "what was the
    weather like in 2023" naturally means the calendar year. current_year
    is simply today's calendar year - the one bucket that, being still in
    progress, only covers 1 Jan through whatever's been synced so far
    rather than a full year.

    The day-grouping is done in SQL, not by reading the table into Python.
    That matters more than it looks: WeatherHistory reaches back to 1987
    (see scripts/import_historical_weather_archive.py), so hydrating every
    hourly row here meant ~350k ORM objects and ~11s per tab open - past
    the frontend's own 8s deadline (LW.NETWORK_TIMEOUT_MS in
    shared/api.js), so the tab aborted the request and showed itself as
    offline while the server was still working. routers/risk.py bounds its
    own WeatherHistory read for the same reason; this one can't bound by
    date (the chart legitimately spans the whole record), so it aggregates
    in the database instead. SQL's aggregates skip NULLs and return NULL
    for an all-NULL day, which is exactly what the previous Python did -
    soil_temp_6cm_c and uv_index are NULL for every pre-2020 row."""
