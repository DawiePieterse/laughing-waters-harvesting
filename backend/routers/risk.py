# Critical Season Risk Indicator: a transparent 0-100 score built from the
# weather drivers that best explained this farm's own harvest variation -
# NOT a generic agronomy model. See build_risk_summary()'s docstring for
# the correlation study behind this list and its caveats.
#
# Each driver is measured over a fixed calendar window (same every year,
# regardless of when picking actually starts) and contributes up to 25
# risk points, scaled between the best and worst value seen across the
# REFERENCE_START_YEAR-onward seasons - so "25/25" means "as bad as the
# worst season on file for this factor", not an absolute agronomic
# threshold.
#
# build_harvest_forecast() (further below) reuses this exact same driver
# list and scoring to turn the current season's still-open windows into
# three kg predictions (Favorable/Expected/Unfavorable) instead of a single
# risk score - see that function's docstring for how.

    season's weather compares to the reference seasons (REFERENCE_START_YEAR
    onward) on the four factors (see DRIVERS above) that best correlated
    with this farm's own season-total kg.

    That correlation study is a one-off analysis behind this driver list,
    not something recomputed live - re-deriving "best" drivers from a live,
    growing sample would make the scoring formula itself drift season to
    season. It was last re-run against the farm's full 1987-2025 record
    (Pearson/Spearman over daily WeatherHistory aggregated into calendar
    windows) once that history was imported, testing ~230 driver x window
    combinations against three samples: block 7 alone 1987-2025 (n=37, the
    one block continuously in production across the whole record - the old
    workbook's "Blok 7" is today's block 7, same 2132 trees planted 1982),
    the old orchard's farm total 1987-2009 (n=23), and the replanted
    orchard's 2012-2025 (n=14). The four kept here are the ones that held
    the same sign across all three and stayed near-independent of each
    other (all pairwise |r| <= 0.37, so the score isn't counting one
    underlying signal four times - an easy trap here, since dew point,
    humidity, dry-hours and diurnal range all measure spring dryness and
    correlate 0.67-0.96 with each other).

    Caveats worth keeping in mind everywhere this score is shown. Weather
    explains roughly a quarter to a half of this farm's season-to-season
    variation (R^2 ~ 0.26 on block 7, ~0.46 on the modern farm total) - real
    signal, but most of a season's outcome is still down to things this
    score can't see. ~230 combinations were tested, so some apparent
    winners are chance; agreement across samples is the real filter, and
    those samples overlap (block 7 is ~18% of the old orchard's total but
    ~56% of the modern one), so they aren't three fully independent
    confirmations. Note also that this farm's record shows NO
    alternate-bearing pattern, contrary to what lychee growers often expect
    and to what an earlier version of this docstring claimed: across 35
    consecutive-season pairs, last season's crop predicts this one at
    r = 0.07 (p = 0.69) - statistically nothing.

    Each driver is scored per season (including in-progress current one) by
    _risk_points() against that reference range, and summed to 0-100.
    A component whose calendar window hasn't closed yet for the current
    season is left out of the sum (never assumed to be zero risk) - see

    """Three kg predictions for the CURRENT season - Favorable/Expected/
    Unfavorable - rather than one falsely-precise number, since most of a
    season's outcome still depends on weather that hasn't happened yet.

    Each of the four DRIVERS' still-open window is projected forward (see
    _project_driver()): actual data where it exists, a real Open-Meteo
    forecast for the next 15 days, and a historical-scenario
    assumption (this driver's best/mean/worst of the reference seasons)
    for whatever's beyond that. Projected values are scored with the exact
    same _risk_points() used by the real Risk tab, so a scenario's 0-100
    score is directly comparable to any real season's score. That score is
    converted to a kg prediction via a simple linear regression fit on the
    historical (risk_score, total_kg) pairs (see _ols_fit(); this
    project's dependencies don't include numpy/scipy, hence hand-rolled).

    Two things worth knowing about the numbers this produces: the
    Unfavorable scenario combines each driver's own worst historical YEAR
    (four different real years, not one real season that was worst on all
    four at once), so its score can land outside anything a real season has
    scored - the four drivers are near-independent, which makes an
    all-four-at-their-worst season very unlikely. Rather than let the line
    extrapolate out there (which ran the unfavorable end past zero into
    negative kg), predictions are clamped to the fitted seasons' own kg
    span, so the extremes read as "as good/bad as the best/worst season on
    file" instead of a falsely precise number. And if the Open-Meteo forecast
    call itself fails, every driver just falls back to a pure
    historical-scenario projection for its whole open window (see
    forecast_unavailable in the return value) rather than the endpoint
    failing outright.
