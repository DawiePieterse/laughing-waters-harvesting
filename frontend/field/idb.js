// current load's running totals - the UI never needs the server to be
// reachable to keep working.
//
// Every request settles: an IndexedDB request that fails without an onerror
// handler would leave its promise pending forever, and because the capture
// screen awaits these on startup that would freeze the whole UI rather than
// just losing one read.

  // longer than a crate can plausibly stay relevant on the device - the server
  // has held it since it synced - while still leaving plenty for the recent
