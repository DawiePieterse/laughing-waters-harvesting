# Laughing Waters Harvesting - server heartbeat for uptime alerting.
#
# Run periodically via a Scheduled Task (set up by setup_heartbeat.bat).
# Only pings the monitoring service (healthchecks.io) when the app itself
# actually responds on localhost, so a crashed/hung server - not just a
# powered-off PC - also gets caught, not just "is the PC on".
#
# The ping URL is account-specific and, like a password, is kept out of
# git entirely - it lives in heartbeat_url.txt next to this script
# (gitignored), one line, nothing else. See MANUAL.md chapter 2,
# "Uptime alerting", for how to create that file.
